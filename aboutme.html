        Hello, my name is Parker Vincent and I am an 18 year old artist that is excited to make a name for himself. 
        Even though I am young I have experience working professionally with companies and individuals. For example, I have provided below images 
        of art I have done for the artist Prey that they use for their spotify banner. So why do I want to partner with Displate?
        Well, I have done a extensive research on Displate and I love everything about it. 
        From the high quality metal posters themselves to the trees that are planted with every purchase. 
        This is why I decided to create this website myself from scratch so I could show my work and establish a partnership with Displate. 
        I believe I would be a great partner due to my simplistic yet elegant designs that can be seen In my first collection called "Duos" depictied on my main page.
        I know that putting these design of mine on Displate metal posters will make them pop even more, and I am sure people will love them.
