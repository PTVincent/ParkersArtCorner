        Hello, my name is Parker Vincent, and I’m an 18-year-old artist that is excited to make a name for himself! 
        Even though I am young I have experience working professionally with companies and individuals. 
        For example, I have provided images of art I have done for the artist -Prey below that they use for their Spotify banner. 
        I have also had a Fiverr account in the past where I made commissions every now and then. 
        Now, I am ready for my next chapter and I want it to be with Displate for a number of reasons. 
        I have done extensive research on Displate as a company and I love everything about it. 
        From the high-quality metal posters themselves and the fact that there are trees that are planted with every purchase. 
        That is why I decided to create this website myself from scratch to show my work and establish a partnership. 
        I believe I would be a great partner due to my simplistic yet elegant designs in my first collection, "Duos" depicted on my main page. 
        I just know that my art on Displate’s metal posters would make a great combination, what do you think?
